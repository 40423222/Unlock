One of the major transport issues today is that of death on the road. In 2010, over 1.24 million people were killed in traffic accidents. That is an amount equal to the population of Bahrain. Of these 1.24 million people, the majority were young; in many countries, car accidents are the most common cause for the 18-24 age group. We look at the situations that lead to traffic accidents and propose some solutions to these problems, and suggest some of the most useful actions that can be taken to reduce deaths on the road.<br>
今天主要交通問題之一,死於路上.在2010年,超過1.24百萬人死於交通事故.這數量相當於巴林人口.在這1.24百萬人,大多是年輕人;在許多國家的車禍普遍死於18到24歲.我們看看導致交通事故的情況,並提出解決方案,並建議最有效的行動能減少死於路上.
<p>
Although there are many reasons for the high number of deaths on road, 90% of accidents are caused by human error. This major cause includes activities such as speeding, not wearing a motorcycle helmet – which protects against head injuries – and not wearing a seat belt. Other causes of accidents can be the condition of the road and of the cars on them. The number of cars in a country and the drives’ attitude to road safety both have an effect on the number of people killed in road accidents.<br>
雖然在路上有許多死亡的原因,90%都是由人為疏失造成.主要原因包括超速,不戴機車安全帽(保護頭部受到傷害),不系上安全帶.其他事故原因可能是道路和車子的狀態.在國家內的汽車數量和駕駛者對道路安全的態度,影響人們在道路事故的死亡數量.然而,可以採取行動減少道路死亡的數量.
<p>
Most solutions to improve road safety are about changing the behavior of drivers. One of the most obvious actions that can be taken is to introduce speed limits. People who go faster than the speed limit should be punished with a heavy financial penalty. In areas where road accidents are common, cameras can be put on the sides of the road to watch the speed of the traffic. Laws should be introduced to make it compulsory for all drivers and passengers to wear a seat belt, with financial penalties if they do not. In areas where people live, speed bumps, which encourage drivers to go slower, should be introduced. Finally, drivers should be made aware of the dangers of driving too fast or without care.<br>
大多提升道路安全的方法,改變駕駛者的行為.其中最明顯的方式就是限速.超速的人要處以大量的罰金.在這區域道路事故是常見的,能在路旁放置攝影機來觀看交通速度.使用法律,駕駛者和乘客必須系上安全帶,如果不系上將開罰單.在這區域應該使用減速坡道,鼓勵駕駛者緩慢前進.最後,駕駛者應該要注意駕駛速度或意料外的危險.
<p>
There is no doubt that road accidents are one of the major causes of death in the world today and it is an issue that affect all of us. Unless governments take action, more people will be killed on the road. However, if everyone drove more slowly and carefully, fewer people would die.<br>
不要懷疑,道路事故是現今主要死亡原因之一,是影響全部人的問題.如果政府不採取行動,會有更多人死於路上.然而,如果沒個人緩慢並小心駕駛,死亡人數就會減少.
