<h2 align="center">Public and private transport</h2>
You want to travel alone, but do not have their own transport. At this time there are two options, to take the ride with others, or take their own one. The following is a real case.<br>
想要自己一個人去旅行,但沒有自己的交通工具.在這時候有兩個選擇,要跟別人一起搭乘,還是自己一人搭乘.以下有實際案例.
<p>
<p>
<b>Public transport:</b><br>
With public transport by means of public transport, you can increase the chances of communicating with others, maybe meeting people who want to go to the same destination with them to increase travel companions. Because it is a large number of passengers, so the price will be cheaper than the pick-up and drop-off, and The impact of environmental pollution is also less.<br>
跟大眾一起搭乘交通工具,可以增加跟別人交流的機會,說不定會遇到要去跟自己相同目地的人,增加旅遊同伴.因為是一次載大量的乘客,所以價錢會比專人接送便宜,而且對環境物染的影響也較少.<br>
On the contrary, you do not have a lot of room for yourself, and may interfere with the people next to it.General passenger transport will have several stations.When there are people in every station who want to get off, the journey will be longer.Most important thing is that the route is Can not change itself, can only choose the route to plan your trip.<br>
相反的,你不會有很多自己的空間,而且可能配旁邊的人干擾.一般的客運都會有好幾站,當每一站都有人要下車時,路程會更久.最重要的事,路線是不能自行改變得,只能選擇路線,來規畫你的旅行.<br>
Advantages: to recognize new friends, cheap, less pollution to the environment<br>
大眾客運的優點: 能認識新朋友、價錢便宜、對環境的污染少<br>
Disadvantages: it is difficult to have their own free space, take a long time, can not change the passenger to go to the place<br>
大眾客運的缺點: 很難有自己的自由空間、乘坐時間久,不能自己改變客運要去的地點
<p>
<b>Private transport:</b><br>
One person traveling alone can have leisure and free space, no one interferes with you and can concentrate on enjoying your trip, because only a few passengers can be picked up, the price will be more expensive than that of the public, and the impact on the environment is even worse Big.<br>
自己一人搭乘交通工具,可以有悠閒並自由的空間,不會有人干擾你,能專心享受自己的旅行.因為只接送少數乘客,所以價錢會比大眾交通昂貴,而且對環境物染的影響也較大.<br>
Conversely, you can not meet new friends and lose the chance to talk face-to-face with you.Private pick-up You can choose your own location and plan your travel more freely because you only need to pick-up and pick-up your passenger so go straight to where you are going location.<br>
相反的,你無法認識新朋友,而且失去跟人面對面談話的機會.專人接送你能自己選擇地點,你能更自由的規劃旅行路線.因為只需要接送你這個乘客,所以直接前往你要去的地點.<br>
Advantages: to concentrate on their own travel, to choose their own place, spend less time<br>
專人接送的優點: 能專心自己的旅行、能選擇自己要的地點、花的時間少<br>
Disadvantages: not recognize new friends, expensive, more pollution to the environment<br>
專人接送的缺點: 不能認識新朋友、價錢昂貴、對環境的汙染多
