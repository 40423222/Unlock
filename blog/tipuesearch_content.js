Female Grizzlies produce 1 to 4 cubs every other year. The weight of each young child is only 500 grams. 習性: 灰熊通常獨居生活,但是在沿海地區,灰熊在鮭魚產卵的季節會聚集在溪流、河流、湖泊和池塘周圍。 雌性灰熊每隔一年生產1至4頭幼崽每頭幼崽重量僅為500克。 Physical capacity: Female Grizzlies weighing 130 to 200 kg, the average weight of male Grizzlies 180 to 360 kg, the average length of subspecies 198 cm.

Up until 2008, it was declared 'extinct in the wild'. Only the determined efforts of a group of scientists and zoos have allowed this unique animal to be returned to the wild in its homeland of Mongolia. However, its survival is not guaranteed and it is still considered a rare and endangered species. 蒙古野馬是真正的野馬在今天仍再滅絕.直到2008,公告'在野外滅絕'.只有決心的科學家和動物園有合法將這特殊動物回歸到野外在蒙古它們的家鄉.然而它們倖存不能保證仍是被尊重的濒危物種. The Mongolian wild horse is unique, as it has never been successfully domesticated and remains a wild animal even today. Before the population declined, these horses could be found in many countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The species was first identified and scientifically analyzed in 1881, but there is no agreement about whether it is a full species or a subspecies of the original wild horse. However, there is agreement that it is probably the closest wild relative of the domestic horse. In appearance, the Mongolian wild horse generally has a bigger body than a domestic horse and has shorter legs. Its coat can vary from brown to beige, with a white stomach and dark mane and tail. In the wild, the horses live in small, permanent family units. Each unit has one stallion – the male horse – and one to three mares, or female horses, plus their foals, the young horses. 蒙古野馬是獨特的,它絕不會成功被馴服,甚至到今天也是野生動物.之前人口下降,這些馬應該在東歐和中亞的許多國家發現.這物種在1881第一次被科學家鑑定和分析,但對於他是否是原始野馬的完全種或亞種,沒達成一致.然而有個協議大概是國內馬密切的野生親戚.在外觀上,蒙古野馬通常有巨大身體和長腳比起國內馬.它外皮能變化從棕色到米色,以及白色腹部跟黑色的鬃毛和尾巴.在野外,這些馬固定在小家庭單位生活.每單位有一個公馬和一到三的母馬或雌馬,加上產下的年輕的馬. During the 20th century, the native population declined because of the harsh climate and human behaviour, such as hunting and using water sources for farm animals. The last herd, or group, of horses was seen in Mongolia in 1967 and the last horse in 1969. No more animals were found in the wild and the species was declared ‘extinct in the wild'. Since 1945, there had been two groups of Mongolian wild horses in zoos in Munich and Prague, but by the 1950s, there were only about twelve breeding horses alive in the world. All Mongolian wild horses alive today are descended from these twelve. In 1977, a breeding programme was started by scientists in the Netherlands and horses were exchanged by the zoos to increase the gene pool of the species. 在20世紀期間,本地人口下降因為嚴酷氣候和人類行為,像是獵殺和使用水源灌溉牧場動物.最後的馬群,在1967蒙古被看見和最後一批馬在1969.在野外沒發現更多動物並公告這物種是‘在野外滅絕'.自1945以來,有兩組蒙古野馬在慕尼黑和布拉格的動物園,但到了1950,只有12頭養殖馬活在這世界上.今天全部活著的蒙古野馬降到12頭.在1977,一個養育計畫由在荷蘭的科學家開始,馬由動物園交換來增加這物種的基因庫. In 1992, sixteen horses were released into the wild in Mongolia and between 2004 and 2005, another twenty-two horses were released. These horses successfully reproduced and the status of the animal was changed from 'extinct in the wild' to 'endangered' in 2005. As well as the new herds in Mongolia and the horses still in zoos, there are specialized reserves in Ukraine and Hungary where the horses can be monitored and researched for theprogramme . While the Mongolian wild horse remains on the endangered list, its future looks good. 在1992,十六批馬釋放到蒙古野外,在2004到2005之間另外釋放二十二批馬這些馬成功繁殖,並在2005動物狀態從‘在野外滅絕'改變成‘濒危'.除了新一群在蒙古動物園內的馬,在烏克蘭和匈牙利內有專門存量,在這能監測和研究的計畫.而蒙古野馬殘餘在瀕危名單上,未來看是不錯.
