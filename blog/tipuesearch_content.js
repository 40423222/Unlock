Malaysia – one country, three cultures 馬來西亞 – 一個國家,三個文化 Malaysia is a country where three very different cultures live and work side by side, each culture following its own traditions. This can be most clearly seen in the different marriage ceremonies of these groups: Malay, lndian and Chinese. 馬來西亞是一個國家,有三個非常不同的文化,生活和工作並肩.最能顯示不同的婚姻儀式: 馬來西亞, 印度, 中國. In the Malay wedding tradition, a relative of the groom visits the bride's house bringing gifts including sweets and the engagement ring. On the morning of the wedding day, the bride and groom each have a special bath as required in Islam. The centre of the traditional Malay wedding is the marriage vow, a promise which is said in front of the imam – the priest – and their relatives and friends. The imam asks everybody if they have heard the vow clearly, and when they say yes he finishes the ceremony with a doa – a prayer asking for blessings from god. 在馬來西亞婚禮傳統,新郎的親戚訪問新娘的家,送禮物要包含甜食和訂婚戒子.在婚禮當天早上,新娘和新郎當要特別的伊斯蘭浴.傳統馬來西亞婚禮的中心是婚姻宣言,在imam – 牧師 – 其他親戚和朋友前說一個承諾.imam問每個人,如果他們宣言有聽清楚,並說:[是]用doa完成儀式 – 祈禱請求神的祝福. In some ways, the Malay wedding ceremony is similar to the Indian wedding ceremony. The Indian wedding ceremony tends to be the most complicated, with very strict wedding customs. The bride and groom eat no meat for several days before the wedding. On the morning of the wedding day, henna – a natural brown paint – is put on the bride's hands and feet in beautiful designs. She them dresses in a brightly coloured sari and puts on the jewellery the groom has given her. No one wears white or black at the wedding, as these are the colours for funerals. 在一方面,馬來西亞婚禮儀式類似印度婚禮儀式.印度婚禮儀式通常很複雜,非常嚴肅婚禮習俗.新娘和新郎在婚禮前幾天不能吃肉.婚禮當天早上,henna – 天然棕色油漆 – 以美麗設計放在新娘的手和腳.她穿上明亮顏色的sari,並戴上新郎給她的首飾.沒人在婚禮上穿白色或黑色,這些顏色是葬禮再穿的. Colour is also very important in the traditional Chinese wedding ceremony. Red, which means wealth and happiness, is used to decorate the bride's house. As well as the marriage ceremony, two important tea ceremonies are performed on the wedding day. In the first one, the bride gives tea to her parents by herself, before the wedding ceremony. The second one is when the bride and groom give tea to his parents at the end of the wedding. The wedding ceremony itself starts with the groom coming to the bride's house to collect his bride. However, the friends and relative of the bride try to stop him. Although this has a serious meaning, there is a lot of laughing and joking as the groom gets to his bride. The ceremony is very simple, with the bride and groom asking for blessings for their marriage. Unlike Malay and Indian weddings, the Chinese wedding has no priest or imam. 在傳統中國婚禮儀式裡顏色很重要.紅色代表財富和幸福,用來裝飾新娘的家.除了這婚姻儀式, 在婚禮當天演出兩次重要茶儀式.第一次,新娘得到茶,並給父母,在婚禮儀式之前.第二次,新娘和新郎得到茶,在婚禮結束給他們父母.婚禮儀式本身是由新郎去新娘家來接新娘.然而,新娘的朋友和親戚嘗試阻止她.雖然這有嚴肅意思,這有很多笑聲和玩笑在新郎得到新娘.這儀式非常簡單,新娘和新郎請求婚姻的祝福.不像馬來西亞和印度婚禮,中國婚禮沒有牧師或imam. These three types of traditional weddings can still be found in Malaysia. However, young people today tend to choose simpler weddings to fit in with their busy lifestyles and financial circumstances. 三種類型的傳統婚禮仍然可以在馬來西亞找到.然而,現在的年輕人傾向選擇簡單的婚禮,適合繁忙的生活方式和財務狀況. 1. In the Malay tradition, a friend of the groom visits the bride's house. 在馬來西亞傳統,新郎的朋友去辦訪新娘家. Choose: False (是親戚,不是朋友) 2. On the morning of her wedding day, an Indian bride has henna painted on her hands and feet. 在婚禮當天早上,印度新娘有henna,繪畫在手和腳. Choose: True 3.

However, fewer than 140,000 individuals are thought to be left and most of them are found in Scotland. In contrast, grey squirrel are now so common they are seen as a pest and can be legally trapped and destroyed. The population decrease in red squirrel is claimed to be due to the introduction of the grey squirrel from North America, but disease and the loss of its native woodland habitat have also played a major role in the decline of the red squirrel in Britain. 紅松鼠在英國森林和農田是常見的.然而少於140000隻,大多在蘇格蘭發現.相反的,灰松鼠是現在常見的,就像禍害並法律同意滅絕.宣稱紅松鼠數量下降是因為從北美引進灰松鼠,但疾病和棲息地減少也是英國紅松鼠下降主要原因. On first sight, the two species of squirrel are similar. They both have a distinctive long tail, which helps the squirrel to balance when jumping from tree to tree, and the same large eyes, small ears and powerful back legs. However, the grey squirrel has a clear physical advantage over the red. The red squirrel has a typical head-and-body length of 19 to 23 centimetres, a tail length of 15 to 20 centimetres and a body weight of 250 to 340 grams. Compared to this, the grey squirrel is a larger animal. The head and body measures between 23 and 30 centimetres long and the tail is between 19 and 25 centimetres long. Adult grey squirrel are heavier, weighing between 400 and 600 grams. This size allows them to store more fat and help them to survive a harsh winter, which would be fatal to their smaller cousins. 在第一眼上,兩種松鼠類似.他們都有獨特的長尾八,那能幫助松鼠在跳躍樹時保持平衡,並有相同大眼,小耳朵和強力的後腿.然而灰松鼠體型明顯優於紅松鼠.典型的紅松鼠頭加身體長19到23公分,尾巴長15到20公分並重250到340公克.相較灰松鼠,灰松鼠是大型動物.頭到身體測量在23到30公分之間並尾巴是19到25公分之間.成年的灰松鼠在400到600公克之間.這尺寸儲存更多脂肪來幫助生存在惡劣冬天,這對紅松鼠是致命的. So why are red squirrels losing out in competition with grey squirrels? Size is one factor but there are others. Red squirrels live high up in trees, whereas greys spend more of their time on the ground. This means that any reduction in forest habitat greatly affects the red squirrel population. Another reason for the grey squirrel's success is its ability to use food provided by humans. Like the fox, the grey squirrel can survive in an urban environment because of its intelligence and adaptability. The other problem for the red squirrel is disease. Both squirrels carry the parapox virus. While this does not seem to affect grey squirrels, it is fatal to reds. 所以為什麼比起灰松鼠,紅松鼠失去競爭?尺寸是一個因素,但有其他原因.紅松鼠生活在樹上裡,而灰松鼠花費在地面的時間較長.所以森林棲息地減少影響對紅松鼠很大.另一個原因灰松鼠能吃人類提供的食物.就像狐狸,灰松鼠能生存在城市環境內,因為它聰明跟適應性.另一問題紅松鼠的疾病.兩種松鼠都有parapox病毒.而不影響灰松鼠,對紅松鼠致命. There does not seem to be much we can do to help red squirrels survive. Some politicians support destroying populations of grey squirrels but this would be seen as cruel by most people in Britain. However, red squirrels have been successfully introduced from other countries and they could be effectively protected in places like the isle of Wight and Anglesey, where there are no grey squirrels. Another question is whether we should protect red squirrel at all. Worldwide, they are not an endangered species, so many scientists would prefer government conservation funding to be spent on other endangered animals. 似乎我們沒太多可以幫助紅松鼠.一些政治家支持消滅灰松鼠,但會被大多數英國人視為殘忍的.然而紅松鼠成功引進其他國家並可以在有效保護區域,像是懷特和安格爾西,在這沒有灰松鼠.在全世界他們不是危險物種,所以許多科學家喜歡政府將保育經費花在其他瀕危動物上. 回答 (P.22) 4.Read the summary below and circle the correct words to complete it. 閱讀下方摘要並圈正確的單字來完成.

Up until 2008, it was declared 'extinct in the wild'. Only the determined efforts of a group of scientists and zoos have allowed this unique animal to be returned to the wild in its homeland of Mongolia. However, its survival is not guaranteed and it is still considered a rare and endangered species. 蒙古野馬是真正的野馬在今天仍再滅絕.直到2008,公告'在野外滅絕'.只有決心的科學家和動物園有合法將這特殊動物回歸到野外在蒙古它們的家鄉.然而它們倖存不能保證仍是被尊重的濒危物種. The Mongolian wild horse is unique, as it has never been successfully domesticated and remains a wild animal even today. Before the population declined, these horses could be found in many countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The species was first identified and scientifically analyzed in 1881, but there is no agreement about whether it is a full species or a subspecies of the original wild horse. However, there is agreement that it is probably the closest wild relative of the domestic horse. In appearance, the Mongolian wild horse generally has a bigger body than a domestic horse and has shorter legs. Its coat can vary from brown to beige, with a white stomach and dark mane and tail. In the wild, the horses live in small, permanent family units. Each unit has one stallion – the male horse – and one to three mares, or female horses, plus their foals, the young horses. 蒙古野馬是獨特的,它絕不會成功被馴服,甚至到今天也是野生動物.之前人口下降,這些馬應該在東歐和中亞的許多國家發現.這物種在1881第一次被科學家鑑定和分析,但對於他是否是原始野馬的完全種或亞種,沒達成一致.然而有個協議大概是國內馬密切的野生親戚.在外觀上,蒙古野馬通常有巨大身體和長腳比起國內馬.它外皮能變化從棕色到米色,以及白色腹部跟黑色的鬃毛和尾巴.在野外,這些馬固定在小家庭單位生活.每單位有一個公馬和一到三的母馬或雌馬,加上產下的年輕的馬. During the 20th century, the native population declined because of the harsh climate and human behaviour, such as hunting and using water sources for farm animals. The last herd, or group, of horses was seen in Mongolia in 1967 and the last horse in 1969. No more animals were found in the wild and the species was declared ‘extinct in the wild'. Since 1945, there had been two groups of Mongolian wild horses in zoos in Munich and Prague, but by the 1950s, there were only about twelve breeding horses alive in the world. All Mongolian wild horses alive today are descended from these twelve. In 1977, a breeding programme was started by scientists in the Netherlands and horses were exchanged by the zoos to increase the gene pool of the species. 在20世紀期間,本地人口下降因為嚴酷氣候和人類行為,像是獵殺和使用水源灌溉牧場動物.最後的馬群,在1967蒙古被看見和最後一批馬在1969.在野外沒發現更多動物並公告這物種是‘在野外滅絕'.自1945以來,有兩組蒙古野馬在慕尼黑和布拉格的動物園,但到了1950,只有12頭養殖馬活在這世界上.今天全部活著的蒙古野馬降到12頭.在1977,一個養育計畫由在荷蘭的科學家開始,馬由動物園交換來增加這物種的基因庫. In 1992, sixteen horses were released into the wild in Mongolia and between 2004 and 2005, another twenty-two horses were released. These horses successfully reproduced and the status of the animal was changed from 'extinct in the wild' to 'endangered' in 2005. As well as the new herds in Mongolia and the horses still in zoos, there are specialized reserves in Ukraine and Hungary where the horses can be monitored and researched for theprogramme . While the Mongolian wild horse remains on the endangered list, its future looks good. 在1992,十六批馬釋放到蒙古野外,在2004到2005之間另外釋放二十二批馬這些馬成功繁殖,並在2005動物狀態從‘在野外滅絕'改變成‘濒危'.除了新一群在蒙古動物園內的馬,在烏克蘭和匈牙利內有專門存量,在這能監測和研究的計畫.而蒙古野馬殘餘在瀕危名單上,未來看是不錯.
