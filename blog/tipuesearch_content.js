The future has to be green 未來要是綠色 There is no doubt that our planet is getting warmer and it is generally agreed that is caused by the high levels of greenhouse gasses, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), in the atmosphere. There gases are created when we burn fossil fuels for energy. However, there are renewable source of energy which can be used as greener alternative to fossil fuels. This essay will look at two of the major alternative sources of energy: solar and hydroelectric. It will conclude that more of our power need should come from these energy sources if we are to reduce the speed of global warming. 不要懷疑我們的星球正在暖化,因為有高壓的溫室氣體(二氧化碳),在大氣層.當我們燃燒化石燃料取得能量時,就會產生這氣體.然而再生能源能更環保的取代化石燃料.文章有兩個主要的替代能源:太陽能和水力.結論,多使用這些能源能減少全球暖化的速度. A lot of countries in the Gulf do not only have plenty of oil but also plenty of sun. This sunshine, together with a lot of unused desert land, means that they are the ideal locations to build solar power plants. Indeed, one of the largest solar power plants in the world is the Shams 1 plant in Abu Dhabi. The plant consists of over 258,000 mirrors, covering an area larger than 285 football pitches. The solar plant works by using the mirror to focus heat onto pipes, which are filled with a special type of oil. The heated oil is then used to produce steam, which drives the turbines that change mechanical energy into electrical energy, just like in a traditional electricity generating plant. The energy from this plant is enough to power over 20,000 home. To produce this much power from fossil fuels, over 175,000 tons of CO2 would be pumped into the air every year. 許多國家有海灣,海灣不只有充足的油也有充足的太陽.許多未使用的沙漠區域有陽光,在這些地方建立太陽能發電廠.確實,世界最大的太陽能發電廠之一在Abu Dhabi的Shams工廠.這工廠由超過258,000個鏡子組成,覆蓋這區域285個足球場的大小.太陽能發電廠的運作由鏡子將熱聚焦到管子上,管子填充特殊的油.油加熱後產生蒸氣,蒸氣啟動渦輪機將機械能轉成電能,就像傳統的發電機.工廠產生的能量足夠提供20,000家庭使用.化石燃料產生許多電能,每年超過175,000頓的二氧化碳排到空中. A country like Canada does not have as much sun as countries in the Middle East, but it does have plenty of water. Nearly 60% of Canada's electricity comes from hydroelectric power, making it one of few countries which generates most of its power from renewable sources. One of the most important hydroelectric power stations is the one in the Niagara River, near to the world-famous Niagara Falls. Between 50% and 70% of the water from the river goes through four huge tunnels before the waterfalls. This water then passes through special turbines which provide energy to nearby areas of Canada and United States. Once the water has passes through the turbines, it is then returned to the river after waterfalls. 加拿大這國家沒有像中東國家有許多陽光,但有豐富的水.加拿大幾乎60%的電力來自水力發電,是使用再生能源的少數國家之一.Niagara河川是重要的水力發電廠之一,靠近世界知名的Niagara瀑布.這瀑布50%到70%的水從河川通過四大隧道而來.水通過特殊的渦輪提供能量給加拿大和美國附近的區域.一旦水經過渦輪,水會回到河川之後流到瀑布. The Middle East has nearly half the world's solar energy potential and many countries other than Canada have significant amounts of water that can be used to generate electricity. The important question – will all these natural resources start to be used in place of burning the fossil fuels which are killing our planet? If our environment is to survive, then immediate action must be taken to ensure more power comes from renewable sources such as the sum and water. 中東將近有世界一半的太陽能潛力,許多加拿大以外的國家有相當數量的水能生產電力.重要的問題-將所有的自然資源使用在燃燒化石燃料,會殺死我們的星球?如果我們的環境要生存,必須立刻採取行動,確保更多電力是使用再生能源的太陽和水. 1.

In 2010, over 1.24 million people were killed in traffic accidents. That is an amount equal to the population of Bahrain. Of these 1.24 million people, the majority were young; in many countries, car accidents are the most common cause for the 18-24 age group. We look at the situations that lead to traffic accidents and propose some solutions to these problems, and suggest some of the most useful actions that can be taken to reduce deaths on the road. 今天主要交通問題之一,死於路上.在2010年,超過1.24百萬人死於交通事故.這數量相當於巴林人口.在這1.24百萬人,大多是年輕人;在許多國家的車禍普遍死於18到24歲.我們看看導致交通事故的情況,並提出解決方案,並建議最有效的行動能減少死於路上. Although there are many reasons for the high number of deaths on road, 90% of accidents are caused by human error. This major cause includes activities such as speeding, not wearing a motorcycle helmet – which protects against head injuries – and not wearing a seat belt. Other causes of accidents can be the condition of the road and of the cars on them. The number of cars in a country and the drives' attitude to road safety both have an effect on the number of people killed in road accidents. 雖然在路上有許多死亡的原因,90%都是由人為疏失造成.主要原因包括超速,不戴機車安全帽(保護頭部受到傷害),不系上安全帶.其他事故原因可能是道路和車子的狀態.在國家內的汽車數量和駕駛者對道路安全的態度,影響人們在道路事故的死亡數量.然而,可以採取行動減少道路死亡的數量. Most solutions to improve road safety are about changing the behavior of drivers. One of the most obvious actions that can be taken is to introduce speed limits. People who go faster than the speed limit should be punished with a heavy financial penalty. In areas where road accidents are common, cameras can be put on the sides of the road to watch the speed of the traffic. Laws should be introduced to make it compulsory for all drivers and passengers to wear a seat belt, with financial penalties if they do not. In areas where people live, speed bumps, which encourage drivers to go slower, should be introduced. Finally, drivers should be made aware of the dangers of driving too fast or without care. 大多提升道路安全的方法,改變駕駛者的行為.其中最明顯的方式就是限速.超速的人要處以大量的罰金.在這區域道路事故是常見的,能在路旁放置攝影機來觀看交通速度.使用法律,駕駛者和乘客必須系上安全帶,如果不系上將開罰單.在這區域應該使用減速坡道,鼓勵駕駛者緩慢前進.最後,駕駛者應該要注意駕駛速度或意料外的危險. There is no doubt that road accidents are one of the major causes of death in the world today and it is an issue that affect all of us. Unless governments take action, more people will be killed on the road. However, if everyone drove more slowly and carefully, fewer people would die. 不要懷疑,道路事故是現今主要死亡原因之一,是影響全部人的問題.如果政府不採取行動,會有更多人死於路上.然而,如果沒個人緩慢並小心駕駛,死亡人數就會減少. 1.

Malaysia – one country, three cultures 馬來西亞 – 一個國家,三個文化 Malaysia is a country where three very different cultures live and work side by side, each culture following its own traditions. This can be most clearly seen in the different marriage ceremonies of these groups: Malay, lndian and Chinese. 馬來西亞是一個國家,有三個非常不同的文化,生活和工作並肩.最能顯示不同的婚姻儀式: 馬來西亞, 印度, 中國. In the Malay wedding tradition, a relative of the groom visits the bride's house bringing gifts including sweets and the engagement ring. On the morning of the wedding day, the bride and groom each have a special bath as required in Islam. The centre of the traditional Malay wedding is the marriage vow, a promise which is said in front of the imam – the priest – and their relatives and friends. The imam asks everybody if they have heard the vow clearly, and when they say yes he finishes the ceremony with a doa – a prayer asking for blessings from god. 在馬來西亞婚禮傳統,新郎的親戚訪問新娘的家,送禮物要包含甜食和訂婚戒子.在婚禮當天早上,新娘和新郎當要特別的伊斯蘭浴.傳統馬來西亞婚禮的中心是婚姻宣言,在imam – 牧師 – 其他親戚和朋友前說一個承諾.imam問每個人,如果他們宣言有聽清楚,並說:[是]用doa完成儀式 – 祈禱請求神的祝福. In some ways, the Malay wedding ceremony is similar to the Indian wedding ceremony. The Indian wedding ceremony tends to be the most complicated, with very strict wedding customs. The bride and groom eat no meat for several days before the wedding. On the morning of the wedding day, henna – a natural brown paint – is put on the bride's hands and feet in beautiful designs. She them dresses in a brightly coloured sari and puts on the jewellery the groom has given her. No one wears white or black at the wedding, as these are the colours for funerals. 在一方面,馬來西亞婚禮儀式類似印度婚禮儀式.印度婚禮儀式通常很複雜,非常嚴肅婚禮習俗.新娘和新郎在婚禮前幾天不能吃肉.婚禮當天早上,henna – 天然棕色油漆 – 以美麗設計放在新娘的手和腳.她穿上明亮顏色的sari,並戴上新郎給她的首飾.沒人在婚禮上穿白色或黑色,這些顏色是葬禮再穿的. Colour is also very important in the traditional Chinese wedding ceremony. Red, which means wealth and happiness, is used to decorate the bride's house. As well as the marriage ceremony, two important tea ceremonies are performed on the wedding day. In the first one, the bride gives tea to her parents by herself, before the wedding ceremony. The second one is when the bride and groom give tea to his parents at the end of the wedding. The wedding ceremony itself starts with the groom coming to the bride's house to collect his bride. However, the friends and relative of the bride try to stop him. Although this has a serious meaning, there is a lot of laughing and joking as the groom gets to his bride. The ceremony is very simple, with the bride and groom asking for blessings for their marriage. Unlike Malay and Indian weddings, the Chinese wedding has no priest or imam. 在傳統中國婚禮儀式裡顏色很重要.紅色代表財富和幸福,用來裝飾新娘的家.除了這婚姻儀式, 在婚禮當天演出兩次重要茶儀式.第一次,新娘得到茶,並給父母,在婚禮儀式之前.第二次,新娘和新郎得到茶,在婚禮結束給他們父母.婚禮儀式本身是由新郎去新娘家來接新娘.然而,新娘的朋友和親戚嘗試阻止她.雖然這有嚴肅意思,這有很多笑聲和玩笑在新郎得到新娘.這儀式非常簡單,新娘和新郎請求婚姻的祝福.不像馬來西亞和印度婚禮,中國婚禮沒有牧師或imam. These three types of traditional weddings can still be found in Malaysia. However, young people today tend to choose simpler weddings to fit in with their busy lifestyles and financial circumstances. 三種類型的傳統婚禮仍然可以在馬來西亞找到.然而,現在的年輕人傾向選擇簡單的婚禮,適合繁忙的生活方式和財務狀況. 1. In the Malay tradition, a friend of the groom visits the bride's house. 在馬來西亞傳統,新郎的朋友去辦訪新娘家. Choose: False (是親戚,不是朋友) 2.

However, fewer than 140,000 individuals are thought to be left and most of them are found in Scotland. In contrast, grey squirrel are now so common they are seen as a pest and can be legally trapped and destroyed. The population decrease in red squirrel is claimed to be due to the introduction of the grey squirrel from North America, but disease and the loss of its native woodland habitat have also played a major role in the decline of the red squirrel in Britain. 紅松鼠在英國森林和農田是常見的.然而少於140000隻,大多在蘇格蘭發現.相反的,灰松鼠是現在常見的,就像禍害並法律同意滅絕.宣稱紅松鼠數量下降是因為從北美引進灰松鼠,但疾病和棲息地減少也是英國紅松鼠下降主要原因. On first sight, the two species of squirrel are similar. They both have a distinctive long tail, which helps the squirrel to balance when jumping from tree to tree, and the same large eyes, small ears and powerful back legs. However, the grey squirrel has a clear physical advantage over the red. The red squirrel has a typical head-and-body length of 19 to 23 centimetres, a tail length of 15 to 20 centimetres and a body weight of 250 to 340 grams. Compared to this, the grey squirrel is a larger animal. The head and body measures between 23 and 30 centimetres long and the tail is between 19 and 25 centimetres long. Adult grey squirrel are heavier, weighing between 400 and 600 grams. This size allows them to store more fat and help them to survive a harsh winter, which would be fatal to their smaller cousins. 在第一眼上,兩種松鼠類似.他們都有獨特的長尾八,那能幫助松鼠在跳躍樹時保持平衡,並有相同大眼,小耳朵和強力的後腿.然而灰松鼠體型明顯優於紅松鼠.典型的紅松鼠頭加身體長19到23公分,尾巴長15到20公分並重250到340公克.相較灰松鼠,灰松鼠是大型動物.頭到身體測量在23到30公分之間並尾巴是19到25公分之間.成年的灰松鼠在400到600公克之間.這尺寸儲存更多脂肪來幫助生存在惡劣冬天,這對紅松鼠是致命的. So why are red squirrels losing out in competition with grey squirrels? Size is one factor but there are others. Red squirrels live high up in trees, whereas greys spend more of their time on the ground. This means that any reduction in forest habitat greatly affects the red squirrel population. Another reason for the grey squirrel's success is its ability to use food provided by humans. Like the fox, the grey squirrel can survive in an urban environment because of its intelligence and adaptability. The other problem for the red squirrel is disease. Both squirrels carry the parapox virus. While this does not seem to affect grey squirrels, it is fatal to reds. 所以為什麼比起灰松鼠,紅松鼠失去競爭?尺寸是一個因素,但有其他原因.紅松鼠生活在樹上裡,而灰松鼠花費在地面的時間較長.所以森林棲息地減少影響對紅松鼠很大.另一個原因灰松鼠能吃人類提供的食物.就像狐狸,灰松鼠能生存在城市環境內,因為它聰明跟適應性.另一問題紅松鼠的疾病.兩種松鼠都有parapox病毒.而不影響灰松鼠,對紅松鼠致命. There does not seem to be much we can do to help red squirrels survive. Some politicians support destroying populations of grey squirrels but this would be seen as cruel by most people in Britain. However, red squirrels have been successfully introduced from other countries and they could be effectively protected in places like the isle of Wight and Anglesey, where there are no grey squirrels. Another question is whether we should protect red squirrel at all. Worldwide, they are not an endangered species, so many scientists would prefer government conservation funding to be spent on other endangered animals. 似乎我們沒太多可以幫助紅松鼠.一些政治家支持消滅灰松鼠,但會被大多數英國人視為殘忍的.然而紅松鼠成功引進其他國家並可以在有效保護區域,像是懷特和安格爾西,在這沒有灰松鼠.在全世界他們不是危險物種,所以許多科學家喜歡政府將保育經費花在其他瀕危動物上. 回答 (P.22) 4.Read the summary below and circle the correct words to complete it. 閱讀下方摘要並圈正確的單字來完成.

Up until 2008, it was declared 'extinct in the wild'. Only the determined efforts of a group of scientists and zoos have allowed this unique animal to be returned to the wild in its homeland of Mongolia. However, its survival is not guaranteed and it is still considered a rare and endangered species. 蒙古野馬是真正的野馬在今天仍再滅絕.直到2008,公告'在野外滅絕'.只有決心的科學家和動物園有合法將這特殊動物回歸到野外在蒙古它們的家鄉.然而它們倖存不能保證仍是被尊重的濒危物種. The Mongolian wild horse is unique, as it has never been successfully domesticated and remains a wild animal even today. Before the population declined, these horses could be found in many countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The species was first identified and scientifically analyzed in 1881, but there is no agreement about whether it is a full species or a subspecies of the original wild horse. However, there is agreement that it is probably the closest wild relative of the domestic horse. In appearance, the Mongolian wild horse generally has a bigger body than a domestic horse and has shorter legs. Its coat can vary from brown to beige, with a white stomach and dark mane and tail. In the wild, the horses live in small, permanent family units. Each unit has one stallion – the male horse – and one to three mares, or female horses, plus their foals, the young horses. 蒙古野馬是獨特的,它絕不會成功被馴服,甚至到今天也是野生動物.之前人口下降,這些馬應該在東歐和中亞的許多國家發現.這物種在1881第一次被科學家鑑定和分析,但對於他是否是原始野馬的完全種或亞種,沒達成一致.然而有個協議大概是國內馬密切的野生親戚.在外觀上,蒙古野馬通常有巨大身體和長腳比起國內馬.它外皮能變化從棕色到米色,以及白色腹部跟黑色的鬃毛和尾巴.在野外,這些馬固定在小家庭單位生活.每單位有一個公馬和一到三的母馬或雌馬,加上產下的年輕的馬. During the 20th century, the native population declined because of the harsh climate and human behaviour, such as hunting and using water sources for farm animals. The last herd, or group, of horses was seen in Mongolia in 1967 and the last horse in 1969. No more animals were found in the wild and the species was declared ‘extinct in the wild'. Since 1945, there had been two groups of Mongolian wild horses in zoos in Munich and Prague, but by the 1950s, there were only about twelve breeding horses alive in the world. All Mongolian wild horses alive today are descended from these twelve. In 1977, a breeding programme was started by scientists in the Netherlands and horses were exchanged by the zoos to increase the gene pool of the species. 在20世紀期間,本地人口下降因為嚴酷氣候和人類行為,像是獵殺和使用水源灌溉牧場動物.最後的馬群,在1967蒙古被看見和最後一批馬在1969.在野外沒發現更多動物並公告這物種是‘在野外滅絕'.自1945以來,有兩組蒙古野馬在慕尼黑和布拉格的動物園,但到了1950,只有12頭養殖馬活在這世界上.今天全部活著的蒙古野馬降到12頭.在1977,一個養育計畫由在荷蘭的科學家開始,馬由動物園交換來增加這物種的基因庫. In 1992, sixteen horses were released into the wild in Mongolia and between 2004 and 2005, another twenty-two horses were released. These horses successfully reproduced and the status of the animal was changed from 'extinct in the wild' to 'endangered' in 2005. As well as the new herds in Mongolia and the horses still in zoos, there are specialized reserves in Ukraine and Hungary where the horses can be monitored and researched for theprogramme . While the Mongolian wild horse remains on the endangered list, its future looks good. 在1992,十六批馬釋放到蒙古野外,在2004到2005之間另外釋放二十二批馬這些馬成功繁殖,並在2005動物狀態從‘在野外滅絕'改變成‘濒危'.除了新一群在蒙古動物園內的馬,在烏克蘭和匈牙利內有專門存量,在這能監測和研究的計畫.而蒙古野馬殘餘在瀕危名單上,未來看是不錯.
